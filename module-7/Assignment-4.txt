Fabric Network Maintenance

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with best practices for maintaining and upgrading a Hyperledger Fabric network. Students will understand the importance of network maintenance, develop a maintenance strategy, and explore the challenges and risks associated with network upgrades.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will delve into the critical aspects of maintaining and upgrading a Hyperledger Fabric network. They will explain why regular network maintenance and upgrades are essential for blockchain networks, highlighting the benefits of keeping the network healthy and secure.

Students will then outline a comprehensive maintenance strategy that covers routine maintenance tasks such as patching, backup procedures, and data retention policies. The strategy should include details on the frequency of maintenance activities and the responsible parties.

Furthermore, students will discuss the challenges and risks associated with upgrading a Fabric network to a new version. They should propose mitigation strategies and best practices to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition during the upgrade process.
