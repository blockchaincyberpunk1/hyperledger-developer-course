Fabric Network Topology Design

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with different network topology options for Hyperledger Fabric and help them understand the implications of these choices. By designing a Fabric network topology for a specific use case, students will gain practical insights into how network architecture impacts the performance and functionality of a blockchain network.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will focus on designing a Hyperledger Fabric network topology that aligns with the requirements of a chosen use case (e.g., supply chain, finance). They will create a network diagram to illustrate the layout of organizations, channels, peers, and orderers within their proposed topology.

Instructions:

Select a Use Case:

Instruct students to choose a specific use case for which they will design a Hyperledger Fabric network. The use case should have distinct requirements that influence the network's design.
Topology Design:

Ask students to design a Fabric network topology that caters to the needs of the chosen use case. They should consider factors such as:
The number and role of organizations (e.g., participants in a supply chain, financial institutions).
The layout of channels to facilitate secure and efficient communication.
The configuration of peers (endorsing, committing, and anchor peers).
The placement and configuration of orderers for consensus.
Any additional components or considerations specific to the use case.
Encourage students to think critically about the design choices and how they address the unique requirements of their selected use case.
Network Diagram:

Require students to create a detailed network diagram that visually represents their proposed Fabric network topology. They can use diagramming tools, such as drawing software or online platforms, to create the diagram.
The diagram should clearly depict the layout of organizations, channels, peers, and orderers within the network.
Documentation:

Ask students to provide a written explanation of their network design choices. They should explain how each component of the network contributes to achieving the goals of the chosen use case.
Students should also discuss any trade-offs or considerations they had to make during the design process.
Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The appropriateness of the chosen use case and its alignment with the network design.
The clarity and completeness of the network diagram.
The comprehensiveness and rationale behind the network design choices.
The ability to articulate how the network design addresses the specific requirements of the use case.
