Setting Up a Basic Fabric Network

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in setting up a simple Hyperledger Fabric network. By following step-by-step instructions, students will learn the fundamental concepts of Fabric network deployment, organization creation, channel configuration, and chaincode deployment.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will set up a basic Hyperledger Fabric network using Docker Compose. They will create organizations, configure channels, and deploy a sample chaincode onto the network. The assignment focuses on practical implementation and problem-solving skills.

Instructions:

Environment Setup:

Guide students to set up the necessary development environment, including Docker and Docker Compose. Ensure that students have access to the required resources and tools.
Network Creation:

Provide step-by-step instructions for creating a basic Hyperledger Fabric network using Docker Compose. The network should include the following components:
Two or more organizations (e.g., Org1 and Org2).
Peers for each organization.
A single-channel configuration.
Orderer nodes.
Configure the network to ensure that peers from different organizations can communicate.
Chaincode Deployment:

Instruct students to deploy a sample chaincode onto the Fabric network. The chaincode can be a basic "Hello World" example or a simple asset management chaincode.
Ensure that students understand the process of packaging, installing, and instantiating the chaincode on the network.
Transaction Demonstration:

Ask students to demonstrate a successful transaction on the network using the deployed chaincode. This can be as simple as transferring an asset or invoking a chaincode function to showcase the network's functionality.
Documentation:

Require students to document the entire setup process, including any challenges or issues they encountered during network deployment. They should explain how they resolved these challenges or sought assistance.
Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The successful setup of a basic Hyperledger Fabric network.
The deployment and instantiation of a sample chaincode.
The ability to demonstrate a working transaction on the network.
The completeness and clarity of the documentation, including descriptions of challenges and their resolutions.
