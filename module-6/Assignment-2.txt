Chaincode Development in Hyperledger Fabric

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide students with practical experience in developing, testing, and deploying chaincode for a Hyperledger Fabric network.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will select a specific use case (e.g., supply chain, asset management) and design a chaincode solution to address the chosen use case. They will then write, test, and deploy the chaincode logic to demonstrate its functionality within a Fabric network. Additionally, students are expected to document any challenges they faced during development and describe any optimizations made to improve performance.

Instructions:

Select a Use Case:

Choose a real-world use case that aligns with your interests or expertise (e.g., supply chain, healthcare, identity management).
Provide a brief description of the selected use case and its relevance.
Design the Chaincode:

Define the data structures and assets relevant to your use case.
Outline the functions and logic that your chaincode will implement to interact with the ledger.
Chaincode Development:

Write the chaincode logic using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Go, Node.js).
Implement the functions that create, update, and query data within your chosen use case.
Test the chaincode thoroughly to ensure its functionality.
Deployment and Demonstration:

Deploy the chaincode on a Hyperledger Fabric network, which can be a local development network.
Demonstrate the functionality of your chaincode by executing transactions and querying data.
Include screenshots or code snippets to illustrate the successful execution of transactions.
Challenges and Optimizations:

Document any challenges or obstacles you encountered during the development process.
Describe any optimizations or improvements you made to enhance the performance, efficiency, or security of your chaincode.
Conclusion:

Summarize your key learnings from this chaincode development assignment.
Submission Requirements:

Students are required to submit a document or report that includes the following:

Description of the selected use case.
Design of the chaincode, including data structures and functions.
Code snippets or code files containing the chaincode logic.
Deployment details and demonstration of chaincode functionality.
Documentation of challenges faced and optimizations made.
Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Appropriateness and clarity of the selected use case.
Completeness and correctness of the chaincode logic.
Successful deployment and demonstration of chaincode functionality.
Effective documentation of challenges and optimizations.
Overall organization and presentation of the assignment.
