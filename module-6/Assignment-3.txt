Membership Services and Identity Management in Hyperledger Fabric

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with membership services, identity management, and user authentication in Hyperledger Fabric.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will explore the role of membership services and the significance of identity management in a Hyperledger Fabric network. They will create a guide on how to enroll new users and organizations into a Fabric network using tools like Fabric CA (Certificate Authority). Additionally, students will discuss best practices for securing user identities and ensuring proper access control within a Fabric network.

Instructions:

Membership Services and Identity Management:

Provide an explanation of membership services and their role in Hyperledger Fabric.
Describe why identity management is essential in a Fabric network, especially in terms of security and access control.
Fabric CA Guide:

Create a step-by-step guide on how to enroll new users and organizations into a Hyperledger Fabric network using Fabric CA.
Include instructions on installing and configuring Fabric CA, generating cryptographic material (certificates), and enrolling users and organizations.
Demonstrate how users can obtain their cryptographic credentials (certificates) from Fabric CA.
Securing User Identities:

Discuss best practices for securing user identities and cryptographic keys.
Explain how to manage, rotate, and revoke user certificates to maintain security.
Highlight the importance of protecting private keys and ensuring confidentiality.
Access Control:

Describe how identity management and user enrollment tie into access control within a Fabric network.
Explain how Fabric policies and ACLs (Access Control Lists) are used to control access to resources and transactions.
Provide examples of scenarios where access control is crucial in a Fabric network.
Conclusion:

Summarize the key takeaways regarding membership services, identity management, and access control in Hyperledger Fabric.
Submission Requirements:

Students are required to submit a document or report that includes the following:

Explanation of membership services and identity management.
Step-by-step guide on using Fabric CA for user and organization enrollment.
Discussion of best practices for securing user identities.
Explanation of access control mechanisms in Fabric.
Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and comprehensiveness of the Fabric CA enrollment guide.
Quality of the discussion on securing user identities.
Explanation of access control concepts and their importance.
Overall organization and presentation of the assignment.
