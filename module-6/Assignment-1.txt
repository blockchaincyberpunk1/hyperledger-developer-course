Chaincode Lifecycle in Hyperledger Fabric

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to help students gain a comprehensive understanding of the lifecycle of chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric, from installation to instantiation and versioning.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will explore the various stages of the chaincode lifecycle in Hyperledger Fabric. They will create a step-by-step guide for installing and instantiating chaincode using a programming language of their choice (e.g., Go, Node.js). Additionally, students will understand the chaincode versioning process and how to perform upgrades.

Instructions:

Introduction to Chaincode Lifecycle:

Begin by providing an overview of what chaincode is in Hyperledger Fabric and its role in facilitating smart contract functionality.
Stages in the Chaincode Lifecycle:

Describe and explain the following stages in the chaincode lifecycle:
Installation: The process of installing chaincode on peer nodes.
Approval: How chaincode is approved by organizations to be used on the network.
Instantiation: The process of creating an instance of chaincode on a channel.
Invocation: How chaincode functions are invoked to interact with the ledger.
Step-by-Step Guide for Installation and Instantiation:

Provide a detailed step-by-step guide for students to install and instantiate chaincode in a Hyperledger Fabric network. This guide should include:
Preparing the development environment.
Writing chaincode using a programming language (e.g., Go or Node.js).
Packaging the chaincode.
Installing the chaincode on peer nodes.
Approving the chaincode definition.
Instantiating the chaincode on a channel.
Invoking chaincode functions.
Chaincode Versioning and Upgrades:

Explain the concept of chaincode versioning in Hyperledger Fabric and why it is important.
Describe how to perform a chaincode upgrade, including the steps involved and considerations for backward compatibility.
Submission Requirements:

Students are required to submit a document that includes the following:

An introduction to the chaincode lifecycle.
Detailed explanations of each stage in the chaincode lifecycle.
A step-by-step guide for installing and instantiating chaincode.
An explanation of chaincode versioning and upgrade processes.
Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and accuracy of the explanations for each stage in the chaincode lifecycle.
Completeness and correctness of the step-by-step guide for installation and instantiation.
Understanding of chaincode versioning and upgrade processes.
Overall organization and presentation of the assignment.
