Blockchain Types and Characteristics

Objective: Explore different types of blockchains and their characteristics.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will dive deeper into blockchain technology by exploring the various types of blockchains: public, private, and consortium. They will analyze the key characteristics that distinguish these blockchain types, including their consensus mechanisms, accessibility, and use cases. By the end of this assignment, students should have a clear understanding of when and where each type of blockchain is most suitable, particularly in enterprise scenarios.

Instructions:

Blockchain Types:

Begin by explaining to students that blockchains can be categorized into three main types: public, private, and consortium.
Provide a brief overview of each type and mention some well-known examples for context (e.g., Ethereum for public, Hyperledger Fabric for private, R3 Corda for consortium).
Characteristics Analysis:

Instruct students to analyze and compare the key characteristics of these blockchain types:
Consensus Mechanism: Describe the consensus mechanism typically used in each type (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance).
Accessibility: Discuss who can participate in the blockchain network (e.g., anyone in the case of public, selected participants in private, a predefined group in consortium).
Use Cases: Highlight the types of use cases or applications where each blockchain type excels (e.g., public for cryptocurrencies, private for supply chain, consortium for financial networks).
Suitability for Enterprise Scenarios:

Encourage students to explore specific enterprise scenarios or industries where each blockchain type may be the most suitable.
For instance, they can discuss financial institutions preferring consortium blockchains for interbank settlements due to privacy requirements.
Comparative Analysis:

Ask students to create a comparative analysis chart or table that summarizes the characteristics and suitable use cases for each blockchain type.
The chart should help visualize the distinctions between these blockchain types.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The depth of analysis and understanding of the characteristics of public, private, and consortium blockchains.
The clarity and accuracy of the comparison between these blockchain types.
The ability to identify and justify the suitability of each blockchain type in specific enterprise scenarios.
