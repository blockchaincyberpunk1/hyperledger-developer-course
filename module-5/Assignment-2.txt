Implementing Access Control in Hyperledger Fabric

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to guide students through the practical implementation of access control in a Hyperledger Fabric network. Students will configure access control policies, create role-based access control (RBAC) rules, and understand the significance of access control in ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will get hands-on experience in setting up access control mechanisms within a Hyperledger Fabric network. They will define policies that specify which users or organizations are allowed to perform specific actions, and they will create RBAC rules to manage roles and permissions.

Instructions:

Access Control Policy Configuration:

Instruct students to configure access control policies for a sample Fabric network. They should define policies that control access to specific network resources, such as channels, smart contracts, or ledger data.
Encourage students to specify which organizations or users are granted read and write permissions for various network components.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Rules:

Explain the concept of RBAC in the context of a Fabric network. Describe how RBAC simplifies access control by grouping users into roles and associating roles with specific permissions.
Task students with creating RBAC rules for their Fabric network. They should define roles (e.g., admin, member, auditor) and determine the permissions associated with each role.
Access Control Demonstration:

Ask students to demonstrate the practical application of access control in their Fabric network. They should show how the access control policies and RBAC rules are enforced by the network.
Students can simulate scenarios where certain users or organizations attempt to perform actions that are either permitted or denied based on the defined access control.
Importance of Access Control Discussion:

Conclude the assignment with a discussion on the critical importance of access control in securing a blockchain network. Emphasize how access control measures protect data confidentiality and integrity and prevent unauthorized actions.
Invite students to share insights into how access control aligns with privacy and compliance requirements in enterprise blockchain applications.
Grading Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The correctness and completeness of access control policy configuration and RBAC rule creation.
The clarity of the access control demonstration, showcasing the practical enforcement of access control measures.
Active participation in the discussion, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of access control in blockchain security.
The organization and clarity of the assignment documentation.
