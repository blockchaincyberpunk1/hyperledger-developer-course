Chaincode Development in Hyperledger Fabric

Objective: Gain practical experience in developing chaincode (smart contracts) for Hyperledger Fabric.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will explore the process of developing chaincode, which is the smart contract logic that executes on a Hyperledger Fabric network. You will choose a use case and develop a basic chaincode using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Go, Node.js). Additionally, you will provide an explanation of the chaincode's purpose and functionality.

Instructions:

Use Case Selection:

Choose a specific use case or scenario for which you will develop a simple chaincode. The use case should involve interactions and transactions between participants in a blockchain network (e.g., asset transfer, supply chain tracking, identity management).
Chaincode Development:

Select a programming language (e.g., Go, Node.js) for developing your chaincode.
Write a basic chaincode that implements the logic required to fulfill the chosen use case.
Ensure that your chaincode includes functions for initiating transactions, querying ledger data, and performing any necessary business logic.
Document the code thoroughly with comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
Explanation of Chaincode:

Provide a detailed explanation of the purpose and functionality of your chaincode. Include:
The use case it addresses.
The key functions and methods within the chaincode.
How it interacts with the ledger and other components of the Hyperledger Fabric network.
Any specific rules or conditions implemented in the chaincode.
Testing and Deployment (Optional):

If possible, test your chaincode in a local development environment or on a test network.
Share any insights or challenges faced during the testing phase.
Note that deployment on a production Fabric network is optional for this assignment.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

The choice of a suitable use case for the chaincode.
The quality of the chaincode developed, including its correctness, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
The depth and clarity of your explanation of the chaincode's purpose and functionality.
The completeness of your documentation, including comments in the code.
(Optional) The successful testing and, if applicable, deployment of the chaincode.
