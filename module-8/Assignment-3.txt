 Documentation Review

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to emphasize the importance of staying informed through official documentation in the Hyperledger ecosystem.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, students will select a specific Hyperledger project or tool that they find interesting and relevant to their course. They will then thoroughly review the official documentation of the selected project, including user guides, developer guides, and release notes. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the project's features, functionalities, and best practices as provided by the official documentation.

After reviewing the documentation, students will prepare a presentation that summarizes the essential information they found in the documentation. The presentation should cover key aspects of the project, including its purpose, architecture, usage, and any best practices recommended by the documentation. Students should also discuss how this exercise improved their knowledge and how it can benefit the broader Hyperledger community.
